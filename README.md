# Front-end Applicant Assignment

This repository contains a code assignment for you to complete before your interview at DR. The assignment should take around 1 hour to complete, but feel free to spend as much time as you feel is necessary. There are no definitively "correct" solutions. If you have other code you would also like to show and talk about (e.g. on Github) then simply send us a link to that as well.

As part of the assignment, there are 5 groups of unit tests that are currently failing, and it is your task to make them pass. An extra requirement is to _type_ your functions in order to not have any TypeScript errors.

The unit tests are found under the `src/tests` folder, and they also serve as documentation in regards to what's required from the functions they are testing. In the `src` folder you have the 5 groups of functions that you need to implement in order to make the unit tests pass. 

## How to run
- `npm install` - install dependencies.
- `npm run test` - verify all unit tests.
- `npm run test:types` - check the code for any TypeScript errors.

## How to submit your results

1. You are welcome to fork or [download this repository](https://github.com/drdk/applicant-assignment-js/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Implement your changes as described above, and send us a link to your repository, or an archive with the code files
